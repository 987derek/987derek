What is CNN?
******************

CNN is Convolutional Neural Network.
We developed an AI with CNN. It could recognize 10 different types of items (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck) from an image.

What is Balloon Flight?
******************

Balloon Flight is a challenging game for you to have fun. 

How to use:
***************

To run the source code of creating the AI, Save the file CNN+Increasing_Dropout_+_Batch_Normalization.ipynb to google drive: https://drive.google.com
Then double click the uploaded file, then run the file line by line to replicate the .h5 file
You can test the trained AI straight in googlecolab or using the attached test_image.py file.

To run the game, in command line, install the following:
pip install pint
pip install pygame
pip install pgzero

Then the game balloon.py can be open using any python IDE. Remember to change the path in line 40 to the paht that you save your game file.
